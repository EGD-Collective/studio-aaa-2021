  title: The Closet
  shortDescription: "The entire front face of the closet door is scorched and covered
    in smoke and charcoal dust. \r\nThe inside, however, is far cleaner than everything
    on the outside. \r\nOnly a thin layer of smoke covers most of the inside, but
    you can make out a large clean spot in the middle of the floor and near the door.\r\nThe
    inner handle is damaged and splintered, also free of soot.\r"
