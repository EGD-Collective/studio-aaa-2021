  title: Unsigned Permission Slips
  shortDescription: "You find a pile of permission slips for various things: School
    dances, field trips, and even report cards.\r\nAs you flip through them, you
    realize that all of their deadlines have passed, but none of them are signed.\r\nThe
    report cards are filled with A\u2019s and A+\u2019s"
