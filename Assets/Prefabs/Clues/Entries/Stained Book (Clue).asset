  title: Coffee Stained Book
  shortDescription: This is a lovely old book, with traditional hand-binding on the
    well-worn spine. It was lying face-down on the floor before you picked it up.
    Flipping through the pages, you can see that the entire last section of the book
    has been ruined by coffee stains and made illegible.
