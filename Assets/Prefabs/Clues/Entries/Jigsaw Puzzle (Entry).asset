  title: Jigsaw Puzzle with Missing Pieces
  shortDescription: "It\u2019s a mostly-complete jigsaw puzzle. It looks like it\u2019s
    supposed to be one of those challenge puzzles with thousands of pieces. \r\nIt
    must have taken a lot of time and skill to put together, but parts of the puzzle
    are clearly missing, and some pieces seem scattered or ajar. You can\u2019t seem
    to find the remaining pieces anywhere.\r"
