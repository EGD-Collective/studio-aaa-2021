demon has two textures to em, body and scales. scales is used for any object that starts with scale_. body is used for everything else

demon has several animations on it, the ones that are meant to be used are:

idle (frames 1 - 130) (loop)
walk (frames 1 - 26) (loop)
stagger (frames 1 - 75)
attack (frames 1 - 42)

any other animations are leftover older versions and from testing poses they can be disregarded
